### Join our group for Kubernetes

Are you interested in learning about **Kubernetes** and **DevOps**? Our mentoring group is the perfect opportunity for you to get started! We will be studying the book "**Kubernetes in Action**" by Marko Luksa and meeting every week for two months to discuss the material and answer any questions you have.

To join our group, you should have a basic understanding of Linux and Docker fundamentals. This includes at least an LPIC1 certification or equivalent knowledge. We will be covering advanced topics related to Kubernetes, so it's important to have a solid foundation in these areas before diving in.

Here's what you can expect from our mentoring group:

- We will study the book "**Kubernetes in Action**" by Marko Luksa by following a schedule that covers all the core concepts and advanced topics related to Kubernetes.
- Every week, we will have a session where we discuss the material we covered that week. You should come to the session having read the pages that we have selected for that week.
- We will ask questions about the material covered in the book and randomly select a student to describe it. This will help you stay engaged with the material and retain what you've learned.
- If you're not prepared for the session, we ask that you donate to a charity of your choice and send us a receipt. This is to encourage everyone to stay on track and come prepared for each session.

Here's our schedule for the mentoring group:

- Week 1: Introducing Kubernetes
- Week 2: First steps with Docker and Kubernetes
- Week 3: Pods: running containers in Kubernetes
- Week 4: Replication and other controllers: deploying managed pods
- Week 5: Services: enabling clients to discover and talk to pods
- Week 6: Volumes: attaching disk storage to containers
- Week 7: ConfigMaps and Secrets: configuring applications
- Week 8: Accessing pod metadata and other resources from applications
- Week 9: Deployments: updating applications declaratively

The mentoring group will be held for a total of 9 weeks, with one session per week. Each session will be approximately 1.5 hours long.

If you're interested in joining our mentoring group, please email me at [poorya.sheikh@gmail.com](mailto:poorya.sheikh@gmail.com) with your name and a brief introduction about your background and experience with Linux and Docker.

Please note that the deadline for accepting new members is **March 30th, 2023**. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for considering the mentoring group, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!"
